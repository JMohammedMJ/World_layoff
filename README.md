# MySQL Project World_layoff

## Description
My project focuses on gathering and analyzing global layoff data to offer insights into layoff trends,
focusing on key companies such as Google. One of the significant observations was the layoff pattern over a period from 2020 to 2023, where layoffs occurred at varying scales and at specific points during the years.
